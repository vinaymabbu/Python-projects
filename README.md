## üîê Password Generator

A customizable password generator that helps users create strong passwords based on their preferences.

### üéØ Features

- User-defined password length
- Options to include:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Special characters
  - Numbers
- Always includes lowercase characters by default
- Ensures the final password has at least one of each selected character type
- Uses Python's built-in `string` and `random` modules

### üß† How It Works

1. Prompts user to input desired password length.
2. Asks whether to include uppercase letters, special characters, and digits.
3. Builds a character pool based on selected options.
4. Guarantees inclusion of at least one character from each selected type.
5. Randomly selects characters to complete the password.
6. Returns a secure, randomized password.

### üíª Usage

```bash
python password_generator.py
```

## ‚úÖ To-Do List Manager

A simple command-line task manager that allows users to track their daily tasks, with support for saving data persistently using a JSON file.

### üéØ Features

- View all tasks with status (pending or completed)
- Create new tasks with custom descriptions
- Mark specific tasks as complete
- Automatically saves and loads tasks from a file (`todo_list.json`)
- Graceful error handling for file operations and user inputs

### üß† How It Works

1. Loads existing tasks from `todo_list.json` (or creates it if not found).
2. Shows a menu with 4 options:
   - View tasks
   - Create task
   - Complete task
   - Exit
3. Tasks are stored as dictionaries with:
   - `"description"` ‚Äì the task text
   - `"complete"` ‚Äì `True` or `False` status
4. When the user marks a task as complete, it updates the file.

### üíª Usage

```bash
python todo_list.py
```

## üß† Python Trivia Game

An interactive quiz game that tests the user's knowledge of Python basics with randomly selected questions.

### üéØ Features

- Stores questions and answers in a Python dictionary
- Randomly selects 5 out of 10 predefined questions per session
- Accepts user input and compares it with the correct answer (case-insensitive)
- Displays final score out of 5 at the end

### üß† How It Works

1. Loads a dictionary of 10 Python-related questions with one-word answers.
2. Randomly picks 5 questions.
3. Asks each question and accepts the user‚Äôs typed answer.
4. Compares with the correct answer and updates the score.
5. Shows the total correct answers at the end of the quiz.

### üíª Usage

```bash
python python_trivia_game.py
```

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Standard Libraries Only:
  - `random`
  - `string`
  - `json`

> No external dependencies needed

## üí° What You Learn

These mini-projects help you build understanding of:
- Conditional logic and loops
- Functions and modular code design
- File handling (read/write JSON)
- Error handling and input validation
- User interaction via command-line
- Dictionary, list, and string operations
